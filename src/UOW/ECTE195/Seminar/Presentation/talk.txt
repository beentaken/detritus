-	Goals of the Odyssey:

	-	"erase the memories of the failure of the last two NASA mission
		to [Mars]".

	-	"The Odyssey's mission is to map the planets geology, paying
		particular attention to the role of water; both past and
		present."

-	To carry out it's mission the Odyssey will be equipped with an IR
	(THEMIS) and a gamma ray (GRS: NS & HEND) spectrometer.

-	THermal EMissions Imaging System (THEMIS):

	-	Infrared spectrometer.

	-	Spatial Resolution of 100m.

	-	Comparison to the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on-board
		the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

	-	Used to map mineral distribution.

	-	Also capable of imaging in the visible spectrum at a spatial
		resolution of 20m.

	-	Can judge the suitablilty of landing sites by measuring their
		Thermal Inertia.

-	Gamma Ray Spectrograph (GRS):
	
	-	Neutron Spectrometer (NS):

	-	High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND).

	-	Spatial resolution of 300Km.

	-	Used to map the atomic distribution.

	-	Can detect Hydrogen up to 1m below the surface.

	-	Requires intense cooling to 90K. Approx -184 Degrees Celsius.
		Used black space.

-	Mars Radiation Environment Experiment (Marie):

	-	Solid state radiation detector.

	-	Used to generate statistics on the radiation levels in Martian
		orbit.

	-	Necessary for human missions to Mars as radiation level
		experiments not carried outside Terra's magnetic field.

-	Water on Mars:

	-	Surface Glaciers.

	-	Underground Aquifers.

-	Odyssey originally had a rover:

	-	Moth balled following the failures of the Mars Climate Observer
		(MCO) and the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) in 2000.

	-	Would have carried out experiments similar to Marie.

-	JPL evaluated the mission parameters:

	-	Out of around 200,000 parameters, 10% were found to be mission
		critical.

-	NASA assembled a "Red-Team" of 50 industry experts:

	-	Their goal was to independently examine the Odyssey mission.

	-	Around 140 Actions items tabled from their findings.

	-	Major change from the "Red-Teams" findings:

		-	Problem with main propulsion system (hypergolic).

-	NASA's change of attitude:

	-	Better, faster, cheaper.

	-	Mission success oriented.
