-	07/04/01: A probe was sent out to Mars that could be pivotal in the
	search for water.

-	Odyssey's mission is to map the Martian geology, with attention placed
	the role of water.

-	Pictures from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) indicate that "brief flows
	of liquid water could have been present on the planet as recently as ...
	two million years ago."

-	Articles argument: "The 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter will be attempting to
	erase memories of the failure of the last two NASA missions to that
	destination.

-	Dried up river channels and flood plains are clearly visible in the
	photographs from the Viking missions in the 1970's.

-	"The Odyssey will carry an infrared and a gamma ray spectrometer, plus a
	radiation detector."

-	The orbiter can be placed in "safe mode", which is a physical
	configuration that can be attained once inserted in to orbit around Mars
	to increase the success of troubleshooting.

-	THermal EMission Imaging System (THEMIS):
	-	Successor of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) which is
		on-board the MGS.

	-	THEMIS is a infrared spectrometer but it can also image in the
		visible wavelengths.

-	THEMIS will be used to look for deposits of minerals associated with
	water.

-	Water related mineral deposits may be an indication of where bodies of
	water used to reside as the minerals are left after the water has
	evaporated.

-	Minerals are detected by a deviation from the "black body curve"?

-	Mineral identification is accomplished by decomposing the observed
	spectra and comparing it to a library of laboratory spectra.

-	Infrared spectrography differs to X-ray spectrography by which spectra
	is used as the basis of measurement.

	X-ray spectrographs are used to find the elemental composition of a
	substance, whereas infrared is used for the molecular composition.

-	The Sojourner rover of the 1996 Pathfinder lander had an X-ray
	spectrometer.

-	THEMIS is constructed differently to TES which was originally a night
	scope from a Colt M-16 Assault Rifle.

-	THEMIS has a spatial resolution of 100 m whereas TES has a resolution of
	3Km. Giving THEMIS a finer visual granularity for an increased
	geological definition of an area.

-	Since TES has already identified the "most fruitful region of the
	infrared spectrum", THEMIS will be focusing on those areas of the IR
	spectrum.

-	THEMIS is also capable of imaging in the visible wavelength, to a
	spatial resolution of 20 m. This aids the Global Surveyor orbiter
	1.4 m resolution camera to produce finely scaled maps of the Martian
	surface.

-	These abilities of THEMIS to detect water are important to it's
	principal investigator, Phillip Christensen of Arizona State University,
	Tempe.

-	TES identified three regions of the Martian equator which have an iron
	based mineral called Hematite.

-	The two hemispheres have a differing geological composition, with an
	implication that the northern hemisphere is younger than the south.

-	Data indicates that if bodies of water were to have been in existence
	on the surface of Mars, it would be similar to the glacial vistas of the
	Arctic regions on Earth. As opposed to the palm lined beaches of the
	tropics.

-	THEMIS will also be used to determine the suitability of future landing
	sites by judging their "Thermal Inertia".

-	Thermal Inertia is determined by observing an areas heat dissipation
	over time, usually one Sol (one Martian day).

	Since dust dissipates heat rapidly and denser rocks tend to hold heat,
	the ratio of dust to rocks shows an areas Thermal Inertia.

-	The Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) is another on board experiment
	consisting of:
		-	A Neutron Spectrometer		(NS)
		-	A High-Energy Neutron Detector	(HEND)

-	The GRS is capable of constructing a map of the distribution of the
	atomic elements of the Martian surface.

-	To some extent GRS can also measure the contents below the surface.

-	GRS measures gamma rays emitted from the Martian surface as a result of
	cosmic radiation exciting the atomic nuclei of the various elements
	present.

-	GRS can detect the elemental composition of the upper 10 - 20 cm of the
	surface with a spatial resolution of 300 Km.

-	Element nuclei emit gamma radiation after returning from a state of
	excitation. The radiated energy is characteristic of the element that
	the nucleus belongs to. Thus, elements can be identified by what type
	of gamma radiation they emit.

-	Using phenomenon related to the one above, the GRS can also detect the
	presence of hydrogen, up to 1 m below Martian surface.

-	The incoming cosmic radiation has the capacity to create fast moving
	neutrons when impacting with a atomic nucleus.

	These fast neutrons can strike other nuclei, slowing it down. When such
	a neutron collides with the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, it's kinetic
	energy is considerably reduced, due to the similar atomic weight of the
	hydrogen nucleus to a neutron.

	Hence they become a slow moving thermal neutron.

-	The ratio of slow moving thermal neutrons to fast neutrons is an
	indication of the relative presence of hydrogen. Which is measured by
	the GRS.

-	Since the Odyssey will also be subjected to cosmic radiation the GRS
	will be deployed on a 7m boom. This prevents the GRS from getting
	readings from the orbiters elemental composition.

-	To reduce noise in the readings of the GRS, it will be cooled down to
	90K by a process that dissipates heat to Black Space.

-	Space is considered "Black" if it doesn't contain a radiation celestial
	body, like our Sun.

-	The GRS may become damaged by radiation on the voyage to Mars. If so,
	there are methods that can be remotely employed to attempt repairs.

	However, there is a risk of rendering the GRS useless with the repair.
	Thus it will only by carried out if it is necessary to return the
	instrument to working order.

-	GRS has the important ability to detect chlorine. As chlorine is
	readily leached from rocks in to water. Surface Chlorine deposits may
	indicate a recent water flow.

-	An experiment similar to GRS was flown on the unsuccessful "Mars
	Observer" which disappeared in transit to Mars in 1993.

-	Evidence of recent water flows on the surface of Mars is startling due
	to the instability of liquid water. Generally, liquid water would
	simply evaporate due to the Martian atmosphere.

-	There is also evidence that liquid water may exist in Aquifers under
	"permafrost", below the surface. The water may be kept liquid from the
	internal heat of the planet.

-	Life may exist in such Aquifers, so the areas where possible flows from
	them need to be examined directly to determine existence of such life.

-	An experiment not directly related to the search for water on Mars is
	the Mars Radiation Environment Experiment, or Marie.

-	Marie consists of a solid state ionising device (like a Geiger counter)
	that will measure the radiation levels on the way to Mars, in deep
	space and once in orbit.

-	Such information is necessary to ascertain how much radiation shielding
	to equip astronauts travelling to Mars.

-	Information on deep space radiation levels hasn't been adequately
	measured for human exposure as all of the human missions have been
	carried out within the Earth's magnetic field which protects us from
	the majority of cosmic radiation.

-	The Odyssey mission was originally equipped with a Sojourner-style
	rover. The rover was removed from the mission and shelved following the
	loss of the Mars Climate Observer (MCO) in 1999 and the Mars Polar
	Lander (MPL) in 2000.

	These are the two previous missions that the author was referring to in
	the main argument of the article.

-	The rover was going to help the Marie experiment by taking radiation
	level readings form the surface of Mars.

-	A single mismatch between SI and Imperial units caused the navigational
	error which led to the MCO burning up in the Martian atmosphere.

-	JPL analysed the mission plan for the Odyssey mission and discovered
	that out of the 200,000 or so parameters, 10% are mission critical and
	then devoted more resources to the them.

-	Since the majority of the aerospace industry is still based on the
	Imperial unit system, as opposed to NASA use of SI units, all the
	interface documents contain both SI and Imperial units for each
	measurement to avoid confusion.

-	NASA assembled a "Red-Team" around the same time that JPL was doing it's
	mission plan analysis.

	The team was comprised of 50 industry experts to perform their own
	series of evaluations of the Odyssey mission.

-	Around 144 Action Items were tabled by the Red-Team, some of which JPL
	were already aware of. Since they were formal now, answers had to be
	delivered.

-	The biggest design change that was prompted from the Red-Team was to
	the main propulsion system of the orbiter. It is a hypergolic (the
	combination of the fuel and oxidiser causes a spontaneous combustion,
	hence no ignition necessary) system.

-	The problem was that there was no isolation between the fuel and
	oxidiser perssuarnt line once in the ignition chamber. Which could lead
	to them mixing further up the lines causing a rupture and ending the
	mission.

-	Once the situation was fixed other changes had to be done across the
	board to accommodate them. This led to a larger margin for error in
	regards to the main propulsion system.

-	Due to NASA attempting to save face from the previous two Mars missions,
	the attitude changed from cost reduction to the achieving of the
	Odyssey mission goals, cost not withstanding.

-	Even with some of the funding limitation lifted, the total cost of the
	mission was close to the original figure.

-	The cancellation of the lander didn't reduce the mission cost
	substantially, as the unit was already manufactured. It has been
	moth balled for possible future use.

-	The Odyssey still retains the UHF radio for use with the original rover.

	It can be used by future missions to relay information from rovers back
	to earth.

	Although landers can now directly communicate with Earth, the use of
	an orbiter as a relay increased the amount of data that can be 
	transmitted.

-	The Odyssey orbital will use aerobreaking to bring it in to it's final
	orbit.

	Previously, the idea was to use aerocapture to enter orbit but it was
	too costly with a larger risk of instrument damage.

-	Aerobreaking uses the upper atmosphere to retard the velocity of the
	orbiter.

-	Aerocapture is similar to Aerobreaking as to the method used, however
	the orbiter would be further inserted in to the atmosphere, resulting
	in a greater retarding force.

	This would require extra shielding of the orbiter, which has a
	prohibitive cost attached to it.

-	Another problem would be if the boom that the GRS is attached to fails
	to deploy it will jeopardise the mission since it reduces the
	maneuvering capabilities of the orbiter.

-	One Martian year is 687 Earth days.

-	Due to the necessary cooling of the GRS, there are restrictions such
	that depending on the angle of the sun, it may be inoperable during
	times that the Sun's rays will be entering through the radiative cooler.

	This means that it will take 917 days to get a fill Martian years worth
	of data.
