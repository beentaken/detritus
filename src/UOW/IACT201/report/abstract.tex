\section{Abstract}

This is a feasability report on the potential adoption of stored value cards, or ``Smart Cards'', for use by the student body. This report will discuss the potential uses for the cards as well as various privacy issues that will arise from their use. Advantages and disadvantages of the stored value card system will be compared as well as the potential expansion of use to the staff of the University. Future considerations such as security risks and risk mitigation are discussed at the end.
