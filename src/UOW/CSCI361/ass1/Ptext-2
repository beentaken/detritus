I wrote a program to automatically solve Vigenere ciphers.

It relied on the fact that the character 'e' is usually the most frequent
character in the English language.

Unfortunatly, in the ciphertext I was given, period 4 didn't have 'e' as
the most frequent character.

So I introduced a fudge ability as you can see that it got the first 3
elements of the key correct.

I made a estimate of the key given that it is usually a word from the language
that of the plaintext.

Here is a run of the program:
