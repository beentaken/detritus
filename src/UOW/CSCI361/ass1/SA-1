This monoalphabetic cipher substitution table was divined by looking at the
frequency analysis of the ciphertext and deducing which ciphertext characters
mapped to the cleartext characters according to the well know alphabetic
frequency analysis of the English language.

P   C

a = t
b = h
c = i
d = s
e = a
f = b
g = c
h = d
i = e
j = f
k = g
l = j
m = k
n = l
o = m
p = n
q = o
r = p
s = q
t = r
u = u
v = v
w = w
y = y
z = z
