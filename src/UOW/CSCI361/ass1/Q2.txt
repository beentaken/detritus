Question 2, part 1:

This monoalphabetic cipher substitution table was divined by looking at the
frequency analysis of the ciphertext and deducing which ciphertext characters
mapped to the cleartext characters according to the well know alphabetic
frequency analysis of the English language.

P   C

a = t
b = h
c = i
d = s
e = a
f = b
g = c
h = d
i = e
j = f
k = g
l = j
m = k
n = l
o = m
p = n
q = o
r = p
s = q
t = r
u = u
v = v
w = w
y = y
z = z

Here is the plaintext after transposition:

world became incalculably rich and powerful 
to understand the development of intellectual specialization which is
our first objective we must study further the comprehensive intellectual
capabilities of the sea leaders in contradistinction to the myriad of
physical muscle and craft skill specializations which their intellect
and their skillful swordplay commanded the great sea venturers thought
always in terms of the world because the worlds waters are continuous
and cover three quarters of the earth planet this meant that before

Question 2, part 2:

I wrote a program to automatically solve Vigenere ciphers.

It has not comments and is written in C.

It relied on the fact that the character 'e' is usually the most frequent
character in the English language.

Unfortunatly, in the ciphertext I was given, period 4 didn't have 'e' as
the most frequent character.

So I introduced a fudge ability as you can see that it got the first 3
elements of the key correct.

I made a estimate of the key given that it is usually a word from the language
that of the plaintext.

Here is a run of the program:
