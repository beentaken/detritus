Overview

<P>
This overview page explains the rationale for this ITCS201 Portfolio, i.e.,

<UL type=square>

  <LI><B>The portfolio illustrates the use of simple HTML.</B>
<br>The first skeleton version of the portfolio is constructed entirely using just very simple HTML; with only the basic features of HTML exploited. It illustrates the level of HTML understanding that is required within the subject. For many people the HTML in here will be regarded as trivial and they might prefer to upgrade the portfolio with a million bells and whistles; that's OK provided you can explain all the HTML that you use. Other people may find the HTML totally new and they need to explore HTML further. The advice to these people is 'trust us' if you examine (for just a few hours) the HTML in the many text files (.htm files) that make up this portfolio it will eventually appear very simple. 
<P>References for where to find HTML study aids will be offered within the subject but meanwhile a good place to get started is at the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html">W3 Schools Web Site</a>

  </LI>

  <LI><B>Each student has their own portfolio that needs to be updated regularly.</B>
  </LI>
<br>Definitely examine the files within this portfolio because you need to make lots of updates to these during the subject. The updates to the HTML should all be very trivial and most of your attention should be spent on the XML aspects of the work rather than the HTML.

  <br><br>
  <LI><B>Each student's individual portfolio should eventually include all the assessed work that the student produces and submits.</B>
<br>You should become familiar with zipping up the entire portfolio (i.e., all subfolders and files within your portfolio) into just one large zip file so that you can move it around conveniently from one computer to another. Or sometimes just zip up all the contents of a specific subfolder e.g., lab-viva2 into a self-contained zip file. This basic file management skill will be taken for granted within this subject and will be a fundamental operation in all Lab Vivas.
