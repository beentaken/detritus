	Access to information related to course content, and previously stored information.
	Standard internet access as provided by the University.
	Easy to use, intuitive, customisable interface.


Design Specification Overview:

I/O - Data transfer between User and System
	- Trodes (Specifics in artifact design)
	- Part of the chair system
	- Transductive
	- Transfer protocol

Storage/Computation
	- User Id
	- User DB, eg Notes, observations, comments, etc.
	- Encryption using biometrics (brainwaves)
	- Access rights - User ONLY
	- Method of storage?

User Interface
	- Vision overlay
	- Translation of speech
	- Tracks thought focus
	- Customisation

Artifact Design
	- Chair
		- Auto-adjusting
	- Trode
		- Personal system
		- Re-usable
		- Vanderwall force attachment
		- Wired back to chair
		- If user walks off with system attached it drops off and retracts back to chair
		- Auto-cleansing system (ultrasonic + autoclave?)
