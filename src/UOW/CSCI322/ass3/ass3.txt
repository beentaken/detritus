The /24 has been broken down in to the following subnets:

Network/Mask	Num IPs		Colloquial Name
x.y.z.0/25	128		Laboratory LAN
x.y.z.128/28	32		Academic LAN
x.y.z.160/28	32		Spare subnet
x.y.z.192/29	16		Computer Security LAN
x.y.z.208/29	16		Spare subnet
x.y.z.224/30	8		Admin LAN
x.y.z.232/31	4		Web service LAN
x.y.z.236/31	4		Mail service LAN
x.y.z.240/29	16		Core LAN

Notes:
------

The two UG Labs and PG Lab have been amalgamated in to one subnet.

Considering that the Academic staff are of greater worth than all UG & PG
students combined, they get their own LAN whilst the plebeian throng get the
following jiggery pokery:

	To promote efficiency, traffic for the Lab LAN can be controlled by a
	three tier switching configuration.

	The router interface and the second tier switches all hang of the first
	tier switch, which is smart enough to be configured to make sure
	broadcast frames are sent downstream.

	Each separate LAN has only one second tier switch, any others hang of
	that, thus creating the third tier.

	The Labs respective servers are located on the second tier switch.

	Thus, any traffic for a Labs workstation to their respective servers or
	workstations in the same lab will only have to traverse the switches
	designated for that lab.

	In the event of a student population explosion, the sane thing to do
	would be to create privately addressable LANs that hang of the
	Core network.

The Academic LAN is situated before the spare /28. This is, in the event of
more academics, to ensure that available space can be accommodated. Either that
or to create another LAN for some other purpose, as yet to be determined.

A similar situation exists for the Computer Security LAN.

Should the need to have more that one web server and one mail server arise.
The respective Web and Mail LANs can be aggregated to free up some IP address
space lost in the sub-netting.

The reason for not aggregating them in the first place is to ensure logical
separation and promote security through said configuration.

All switches are considered as, 32 port, managed, separate up-link port, unless
specified otherwise.

All names are canonical, common names are not in the scope of this document.
