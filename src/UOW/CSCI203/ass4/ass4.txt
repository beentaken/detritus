You should write a program to read in an undirected graph and determine 
its articulation points. The algorithm for this task is the one detailed
in class. The choice of appropriate data structure(s) is left up to you.


Input to the program will consist of

The number of nodes 
A sequence of sets of two integers which are the pairs of nodes connected
by an edge.

Input of edges is terminated by the sequence 0 0.

Output should be:

A list of nodes in node number order where for each node a single line 
of output should be produced giving, in order:

The Node number, the Prenum number, The Highest number, an asterisk if 
the node is an articulation point.

The submit program should be used to submit your answer as follows

	submit -u ian -c csci203 -a 4 ass4.cc ass4.h

where your unix userid should appear instead of ian.

Marks will not be given to assignments which fail to compile!
