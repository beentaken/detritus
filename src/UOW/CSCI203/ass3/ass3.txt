Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a given node to all other
nodes.

We observe that we can modify this algorithm to stop as soon as a particular
node is reached; thus producing an algorithm to find the shortest path between
a specific pair of points.

We note that this algorith may involve the consideration of a number of points
which do not lie on the final shortest path.

A proposed improvement on this modifies Dijkstra's algorithm is to start at
both the source and destination nodes and to construct two partial solution
trees in parallel until one node is in both partial solution trees.

Your task is to:

1. Code the modified Diskstra's algorithm to search from the start node out.

2. Code the proposed improved algorithm.

3. Compare the results.

Note: You should produce a single program to perform the above tasks.

Input to the program will consist of

The number of nodes 
A sequence of sets of three integers where the first two are node numbers and
the third number is a cost.

Input of edges is terminated by the sequence 0 0 0.

Finally a pair of integers representing the source and destination nodes for
which a shortest path is required.

Output should be:

The length of the shortest path from solution 1:
The Path (list of nodes) from solution 1:
The list of additional nodes in the solution tree for solution 1
(those not in the shortest path)
The length of the shortest path from solution 2:
The Path (list of nodes) from solution 2:
The list of additional nodes in the solution trees for solution 2
(those not in the shortest path)

The submit program should be used to submit your answer as follows

	submit -u ian -c csci203 -a 3 ass3.cc ass3.h

where your unix userid should appear instead of ian.

Marks will not be given to assignments which fail to compile!
