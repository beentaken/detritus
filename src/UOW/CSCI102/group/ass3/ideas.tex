\item{1:} Testing that all links resolve to the correct page.
\item{2:} Testing that all content is spelling and grammatically correct.
\item{3:} Load testing the server to see that it can handle the expected maximum load.
\item{4:} Find the point where the server will no longer be able to handle requests.
\item{5:} Ensure that all the pages are conforming to the HTML 4.01 standard. See: \it http://validator.w3.org/ \rm
\item{6:} Ensure that the CSS is valid. See: \it http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ \rm
\item{7:} Test to see that there is a uniform feel of the website across all ``major'' browsers.
\itemitem{7a:} Mozilla (Gecko renderer).
\itemitem{7b:} Microsoft Internet Explorer, \it version 6.01 \rm and higher.
\itemitem{7c:} Opera.
\itemitem{7d:} Konqueror.
\item{8:} Ensure that web pages do not take over 2 seconds to load over a generic 56Kbps dial up connection.
\item{9:} See that internationalisation works with browsers that do not use \bf [en] \rm as the default language.
